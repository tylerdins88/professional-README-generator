# Professional README Generator

## Description 

This program generates a readme.md file. Using node.js I ask questions via prompts in the terminal using the cmd line. Based off of the responses, a readme.md file is filled with the related information. See the following video here of how it works:

I store the questions in an array. Each question is called using a required file. If you notice, I use a list type for the licenses to have the user select which licenses to include. See the photo below that shows these choices & type:

## Installation

Install npm via "npm init". Following this, you will need to install inquirer entering, "npm i inquirer@8.2.4". A folder named node_modules will populate. This shows proper steps are happening. Open the directory in the intergrated terminal or terminal you are using. Run the index.js file using node, i.e. "node index". Follow the prompts to beging the file generation. Once completed a file named "generated-readme.md" will appear. 

## Usage 

Once you have successfully installed the correct componenets you will be prompted with the series of questions when entering "node index". You must be in the correct file for this to work. Once the prompts have been completed, the "generated-readme.md" file will be created.
